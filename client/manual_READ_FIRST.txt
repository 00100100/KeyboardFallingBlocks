Keyboard Falling Blocks (KFB) manual

Tested on Chrome

firefox has a problem.
	bug: In game, hold "/" then hold "." then press space.
	Release keys. It acts as if space wasn't hit.

=====
Intro and Theory
=====

This is based off Tetris, but we shall use "KFB" to refer
to this game.

The whole purpose of KFB is that in theory you can play
faster by pressing less keys if you can get past the
ridiculous learning curve.

In Tetris, if you wanted to rotate clockwise
2 times and place the current piece in the 0th column, you'd
have to press: clockwise, clockwise, left, left, left).

With KFB, you just have to press 1 button!

=====
Gameplay Modes
=====
There are two main modes of gameplay. For beginners, it is
recommended that you activate "Space does hard drop". This will
allow you to position pieces using the keyboard, then drop
them by pressing space.

Disabling the "Space does hard drop" option causes the
rules below to be activated. These rules will allow you to
drop pieces with only one key-press.

=====
The Keyboard
=====
Key-press (also known as keydown. Not to be confused with the "down" key)
or
key-release (keyup) executes an action.

shift (hold piece) - hold a piece, to save for later.
		all keys pressed become inert. example below.

space (inert keyboard) - all keys pressed become inert. example below.

enter (restart game)
	-the game freezes when you win because it's not done.

To move pieces, you have to use the following keys:
row 1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
row 2 : q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
row 3 : a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,;
row 4 : z,x,c,v,b,n,m,,,.,/

Each row represents a number of rotations:
row 1 = 0 clockwise rotations
row 2 = 1 clockwise rotations
row 3 = 2 clockwise rotations
row 4 = 3 clockwise rotations

Each column represents where the upper left corner of the
current piece should be.

Example: So if you press "a", then the current piece will be moved
to the first column with 2 rotations.

Example: So if you press "2", then the current piece will be moved
to the second column with 0 rotations.

Example: Pressing 'L' will attempt to shove the current piece to the
9th column with 2 rotations. If the piece is out of bounds,
it will be gently nudged back in. 'L' is not "second column" from
the right, which may be confusing. Some keys will have the
same effect due to this. But the original "upper-left corner
column" rule will stay.

Key-press will place the current piece in a sort of "preview" state
where it will not drop.

Key-release will place the current piece in a "preview" and then
hard drop it. Any keys still being pressed become inert.

Examples, because this may be confusing.

PLAYING
Lets say you press "0", "1" and THEN "2" simultaneously. You want to drop on "1". So release "1".
1. The piece will go to the "1" position and then hard drop.
2. 0 and 1 will be inert. You can safely key-release them.
3. Any other key will work.

CANCELLING
Lets say you press 0, 1 and 2. You don't want any of these moves.
Press spacebar once. You can safely key-release the keys "0", "1", or "2."

Game Cycle
=====

The game operates at 30 frames per second (FPS). at each frame,
the following operation takes place.

HOLD > cancel (if no hold) > command (if none of the above).

Commands are pushed in whenever javascript gets a key-press
or key-release event. They are executed in the "game processing loop"
as a queue. Whatever came in first, is executed first.

There is no gravity due to the difficulty of this game.
It is all a race against time.

This game currently features 40 lines mode.

=====
Settings
=====
- Ghost Piece: turns on the piece preview after drop.
- Rolling Cancel : Keypress the first key and then keypress a second key.
	The first key will be cancelled.
- Keydown Does Hard Drop : Key-presses does hard drop. This makes the game harder.
- Space Does Hard Drop : If enabled, only space allows hard drops.
	Note: Is overridden by "keydown does hard drop"

- Piece Preview Amount : It's the preview amount. Values are from 1 - 7.
- Piece Generator
	- random - all pieces have an equal chance of spawning
	- 14-bag - all 7 pieces are placed in a bag twice. They are randomly taken out.
		when the bag is empty, place the 7 pieces back in there, repeat.
