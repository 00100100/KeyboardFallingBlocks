Keyboard Falling Blocks (KFB) manual

Tested on Chrome

firefox has a problem.
	bug: hold "/" then hold "." then press space.
	Release keys. It acts as if space wasn't hit.

=====
Intro and Theory
=====

This is based off a certain game that shall not be named
due to "reasons." So we shall use "KFB" to refer
to this game.

The whole purpose of KFB is that in theory you can play
faster if you can get past the ridiculous learning curve.
In old falling blocks game, if you wanted to rotate clockwise
2 times and place the current piece in the 0th column, you'd
have to press: clockwise, clockwise, left, left, left).

With KFB, you just have to press 1 button!

The Keyboard
=====
Key press down or up activates an action

some easy keys to memorize.

shift (up) - hold a piece, to save for later.
			all keys pressed are inert. example below.
space (down) - all keys pressed are inert. example below.

enter (restart game)
	-the game freezes when you win because it's not done.

active keys:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p
a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,;
z,x,c,v,b,n,m,,,.,/

Each row represents a number of rotations:
row 1 = 0 clockwise rotations
row 2 = 1 clockwise rotations
row 3 = 2 clockwise rotations
row 4 = 3 clockwise rotations

Each column represents where the upper left corner of the
current piece should be.
So if you press 1 (first column), then the current piece
will be teleported to that column with 0 rotations.

Pressing 'L' will attempt to shove the current piece to the
9th column with 2 rotations. If the piece is out of bounds,
it will be gently nudged back in. 'L' is not "second column" from
the right, which may be confusing. Some keys will have the
same effect due to this. But the original "upper-left corner
column" rule will stay.

Key down will place the current piece in a sort of "preview"

key up will place the current piece in a "preview" and then
hard drop it. All keys current pressed down are now inert.

Examples, because this may be confusing.

PLAYING
Lets say you press 0, 1 and THEN 2. You want to drop on 1. So release
1. The piece will go to the "1" position and then hard drop.
2. 0 and 1 will be inert until keypressed up.
3. Any other key will work.

CANCELLING
Lets say you press 0, 1 and 2. You don't want any of these moves.
Press spacebar once. Lifting specifically the keys 0, 1, or 2 won't
do anything. These are inert until keypressed up.
Any other key will work.

Game Cycle
=====

The game operates at 30 frames per second (FPS). at each frame,
the following operation takes place.

HOLD > cancel (if no hold) > command (if none of the above).

Commands are pushed in whenever javascript gets the keypress
down or up event. They are executed in the "game processing loop"
as a queue. whatever came in first, is executed first.

There is no gravity due to the difficulty of this game.
It is all a race against time.

This game currently features 40 lines mode.

=====
